B-3. Value Range Propagation

Questions :

Q1.  In the file B-3.c, what values can variable `a' take? Will the `if' condition [a  < 4] ever be true? 
     Inspect the file B-3.c.*.vrp1 to analyze the dump.
Ans :
     In the file B-3.c, variable a can take values from 4 to 100, but only within the scope of the loop body.
     The if condition (a < 4) will never be True and the code in the if branch is eliminated in the .vrpl 
     file.
