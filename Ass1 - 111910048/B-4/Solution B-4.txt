B-4. Common Subexpression Elimination

Questions

Q1.  How many times is the expression (a + c) computed in the original code (as seen in the SSA pass)? What
     about after the FRE pass?
Ans : 
  i. The expression (a + c) is computed 2 times in the SSA pass, though the operands are in different orders.
 ii. The expression (a + c) is computed only once after the FRE pass.

Q2.  Have there been any more optimizations after FRE? How will you check?
Ans :
     We can check if there have been further optimisations by checking B-4.c.*.optimized. B-4.c.*optimized is
     the final file after optimisation. No more optimisations are made after the .optimized file.
     It appears that in the B-4.c.*.optimized file also the expression (a + c) is calculated only once, i.e 
     redundant assignments have subsequently been eliminated.

Q3.  Why did we have to put a "return b" in this assignment? What if "return b" is changed to 
      "return 0"? Will it make any difference?
Ans :
     Not returning "b" would result in its elimination as dead code, for example in the case where "return b" 
     is changed to "return 0". If we replace "return b" with "return 0" then also it won't make any difference.
