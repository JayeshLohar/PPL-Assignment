A-1. Declaration, Expression and Assignments

Questions

Q1.  How do the declarations look in the GIMPLE? Specifically, what happens to multiple  variables declared
     and initialized on the sameline? What happens to global declaration [int Z]?
Ans :  
  i. In Gimple, variables are declared on seprate new lines one after other, and then assignment of the values
     to declared variables is done.
 ii. Multiple variables which are declared and initialized on the same line in the sorce code are also
     declared on seprate new lines in the Gimple.
iii. Global variables are not declared in the Gimple, but for using global variable inside an operation, the
     value of global variable is assigned to a temporary variable.

Q2.  How are complex  expressions such as [c  = a * b +  25] broken down? Can you determine a rule as to when
     temporary variables will be introduced?
Ans :
  i. In case of comlex expression, (a*b) is first evaluated and stored in temporary variable "-1". Then _1 is
     added to 25 to get c.
 ii. Whenever we have complex expression consisting of many operators, then the complex expression is broken 
     down into constituent simpler expressions. Each simple expression is evaluated and it's result is stored
     into temporary variables. These expression are evaluated as per the priority in maths.

Q3.  How are floats/doubles represented in GIMPLE? What happens when a float/double is assigned to an integer
     in [Z = r]?
  i. In Gimple, floats/doubles are represented using scientific notation. Floats/doubles are represented as
     only single digit before decimal point multiplied by power of 10. As 34.5 is represented as 3.45e+1 which 
     means 3.45*(10*1).
 ii. When float/double is assigned to an integer then first that float/double is converted to integer i.e, 
     type-casted to integer and stored in temporary variable (_2). Only the integer part is assigned i.e, 
     only part before decimal point. After that this temporary variable is assigned to integer variable.

Q4.  How  are reads/writes to the  global variable  Z performed?  Why is there a temporary introduced  for 
     the statement [Z = Z  + 1] but not for the statements [q = Z] or [Z = p]?
Ans :
  i. In Gimple Read/Writes to the global variable Z performed through loads to/stores from locals i.e,
 ii. A temporary variable is introduced for the statement [Z = Z + 1] because the result of computation Z + 1
     be written directly to a memory location. For the statement [Z = Z + 1], the global variable Z is 
     directly used, so for this a temporary variable is used and further operation is carried out using 
     temporary variable. Finally result is assigned to global variable.
iii. When value of global variable is being assigned to local variable i.e, (q = Z) and also for local
     variable p to be assigned to global variable Z, this is done directly without any temporary variable
     as variable p and q are declar already.
