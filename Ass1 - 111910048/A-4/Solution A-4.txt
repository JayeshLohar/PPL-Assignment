A-4. Arrays and Pointers

Questions :

Q1.  How is array declaration and initialization handled?
Ans :
  i. Declaration of array takes place in single statement with no initialization. Arrays are declared in a new
     line with array length.
 ii. The each elements in array are declared in seprate new line. Here elements of array b are declared in 
     block <bb2>.

Q2.  Why does the statement a[i] = b[i] get broken down to two steps with an intermediate temporary?
Ans :
     In Gimple only one operation is performed at a time i.e, only one memory operation per instruction is 
     permitted. This probably simplifies many things. So here a[i] and b[i] are first assigned to a temporary
     and then temporary variables used for further operation.

Q3.  Why are there CLOBBER statements at the end?
Ans :
     To mark the arrays as invalid  at scope exit - probably to simplify analysis and permit reuse of stack 
     slots, etc. Clobbering memory means overwritng its contents. After clobbering, the memory allocated to 
     the pointer is cleared and the variable can no longer be used.
