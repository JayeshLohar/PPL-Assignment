A-2. Conditional Jumps and Control Flow Graphs 

Questions

Q1.  How have if-blocks  been translated into GIMPLE  statements? Can you differentiate between conditional 
     and unconditional gotos?
Ans :
  i. If/else blocks are translated into goto statements and as per their conditions these goto blocks executed.
     Some temporary lables are given as <D.1975>. Depending upon condition i.e, True/False the control goes
     to respective lable due to goto statements and respectiveblock will be executed.
 ii. The conditional gotos are defined as, if goto statement mentioned inside a if/else block then it will 
     be evaluatedas per the condition of if/else block are known as conditional gotos.  
iii. The goto statement which doesn't depend upon any condition and which always executed is known as 
     unconditionalgotos. 

Q2.  Repeat  the  above compilation,  but  now  asking for  another  dump that  of  the pass  "cfg". View this
     pass and say  whether  this representation makes it easier to  read and understand GIMPLEs. Draw the 
     control-flow graph  of the program A-2.c on a  piece of paper by looking at the CFG dump.
Ans :
  i. It's easy to read and understand the control flow in this representation i.e, in this dump it's bit
     easier to see the control flow in this representation. But in this dump more number of lines are used
     i.e, slightly less conise in terms of number of lines used.
