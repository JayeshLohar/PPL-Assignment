A-3. Loops

Questions :

Q1.  Identify the basic blocks that correspond  to the while loop. How is the GIMPLE for a while loop
     different from simple if-else jumps?
Ans :
  i. The bb3 and bb4 are the basic blocks that correspond to the while loop, where <bb4> checks the condition
     and <bb3> forms the body of loop. 
 ii. In case of while loop, the condition are written in if else form. It checks for the condition in if
     block. Until the condition in if block finds true the while loop executed and when condition become false
     else part is executed.
iii. Here bb2 avoids executing an iteration unconditionally by having an unconditional goto to bb4 which is 
     the while loop condition.In a while loop jump is done to the declared label before the if/else block 
     and sometimes to the label declared after. This is different from if else jumps, in which it always seem 
     to be conditional.

Q2.  Identify the  basic blocks  for the nested  for-loop. You  should be able  to identify  intializers,
     conditions  and increments  for each loop as well as  the shared  inner body. Is there really anything
     special about a for-loop as compared to a while-loop?
Ans :
     bb5 : Intialization of outer loop counter variable.
     bb10: Checks condition for outer loop.
     bb6 : For bb10 is true then intialization of inner loop variable.
     bb8 : Checks condition of inner loop.
     bb7 : Operations inside the inner loop are carried out and increment in inner variable takes place.
     bb9 : Increment in outer loop variable take place.

     The structure of for loop and while loop inside the Gimple are same. There is not much difference 
     among both loops.
     Only the starting of for loop is with intialization loop counter variable.
